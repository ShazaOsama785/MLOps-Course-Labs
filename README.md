🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction with MLflow
This project aims to predict whether a bank customer will leave the service (churn) using various machine learning models. It includes full support for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model tracking/logging via MLflow.

📊 Dataset
Source: Churn_Modelling.csv

Key Features: CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.

Target: Exited (0 = stayed, 1 = churned)

⚙️ Project Workflow
Data Rebalancing
Handles class imbalance using downsampling.

Preprocessing

Scales numerical features

One-hot encodes categorical features (Geography, Gender)

Saves the column transformer to disk

Model Training & Evaluation
Three models are trained and evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

MLflow Logging
Automatically logs:

Parameters

Metrics

Confusion matrix images

Trained model artifacts

Model signature for reproducibility

🤖 Models Used
Model	Accuracy	Notes
Logistic Regression	~73%	Baseline model
Random Forest	~75%	Moved to staging
SVM (RBF kernel)	76%	Deployed to production

🚀 Production Setup
✅ SVM Model (RBF kernel, C=1.0, gamma=scale) gave the best accuracy (76%) and is deployed to Production.

🧪 Random Forest is placed in Staging for further validation.
